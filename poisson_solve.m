% Solves poisson equation of the form Del^2(psi) = func
% 
% Inputs:
%   - func:     NxN matrix, right hand side of Poisson equation
%   - ps:       pixel size
%   - eps:      regularization parameter to prevent division by zero
%   - symm:     [on/off] symmetric FFT to produce purely real output
%   - reflect:  [on/off] reflect image for periodic boundary conditions
%
% Outputs:
%   - Psi_xy:   purely real solution to Poisson equation
%
% Notes:
%   - The 'reflect' feature will quadruple the size of the image, and thus
%     significantly increase computation time.
